**Arkmon** is a game prototype that blends classic monster-taming mechanics (inspired by *Pokémon*) with **grid-based tactical combat** and a rich, arcane world. You take on the role of an **Ark Hunter**, capturing and commanding magical creatures born from raw arcane energy.

## 🌌 World of Arkmon

## 🌟 Vision: Dynamic Environments & Tactical Depth

The long-term goal of **Arkmon** is to make each battle feel unique by integrating **terrain, weather, and monster abilities** into the core combat mechanics:
One Example: 
- Ice-type Arkmon will be able to **freeze rivers or lakes** to create temporary ice bridges.
- Only certain monster types (e.g., Ice-types) will **move across them safely**.
- Other types might **slip** or face **movement penalties**, making battlefield control and environmental strategy crucial.
- The environment should become an **active element in combat**, not just a backdrop.

These mechanics are currently in **concept and design** and represent the **core vision** of what Arkmon aims to become.
